# nyquist
This program is to be a Nyquist demonstration plotter in R/Shiny

It will plot a set of increasing amplitude sine waves to demonstrate the Nyquist sampling criteria graphically.

The plotter will plot several pi worth of cycles and then with a slider allow the user to modify the sample rate of the signal to demonstrate what the minimum criteria should be to sample a given frequency signal. I plan to add to the demonstration a frequency modulated signal and some other demonstration bells and whistles.
